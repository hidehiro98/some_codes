Bird's second homer of the series, a towering drive into the second deck in right field, provided some desperately needed support behind Tanaka's dominant outing. With the Indians flailing regularly at his lethal splitter, Tanaka blanked Cleveland's formidable offense on three hits through seven frames, issuing one walk with seven strikeouts over a 92-pitch effort.

New York trails the best-of-five series, 2-1, with Game 4 set to be played at Yankee Stadium on Monday at 7 p.m. ET. It marked the Yankees' first 1-0 postseason victory since Game 3 of the 2001 ALDS against the Athletics, a series in which the Yanks rallied from an 0-2 deficit.
"Plain and simple, I'm not ready to be done playing and I don't think the rest of the team is," Bird said. "I'm just very happy with that and knowing it gives us a chance, really. It was an incredible experience, an incredible game, and we're not done."
